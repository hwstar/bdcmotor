This is an implementation in Verilog of a brushed DC motor PWM generator and quadrature tach
counter in an interface called a "motor channel".

The processor communication interface is SPI.

This design provides 3 motor channels. 

This project is in the early stages of development, and is being used to test the
open source toolchain for the Lattice ICEStick.
